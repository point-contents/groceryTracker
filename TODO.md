# Front End
fix sizes of charts, and then maybe add some more charts,
ie week to date, month to date, year to date etc.

add a favicon so that there is no error in the inspector

add ascesibility stuff.

# Server End
add tests

add proper logging like morgan or something etc

add await to the routes that need it, specifically the ones that are calling
the database.

figure out if its a good idea to have CSS separate / is there a way to make
it load quicker,

	This seems to be getting better by just injecting a bunch of stuff into the
	template, but then it is difficult to see what is going on in the browser
	inspector.

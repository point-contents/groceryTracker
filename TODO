fix sizes of charts, and then maybe add some more charts,
ie week to date, month to date, year to date etc.

add a favicon so that there is no error in the inspector

add ascesibility stuff.

add tests

add proper logging like morgan or something etc

figure out if its a good idea to have CSS separate / is there a way to make
it load quicker,

	This seems to be getting better by just injecting a bunch of stuff into the
	template, but then it is difficult to see what is going on in the browser
	inspector.

Make multiuser, this means what for the database stuff???

	So to continue on with the multiuser idea, maybe we can get some of the information
	from the auth0 user, and create an hashtable, where the we make a uuid of the users 
	and then on the other side have a hash of their email that we got from auth0.
	we can then use the uuid in the database as a field that we can later search by?
	obvs wouldnt scale well, but I would like to at least get this working a bit better
